        <h2 id="Question1">How can the bounty hunters track each one of their targets?</h2>
            <p>They use "tracking fobs". The closer you get to a target, the faster the fob will beep. It isn't clear how the fobs locate the targets. It's likely tracking the DNA signature of the species of the target, also known as a "chain code".</p>
        <h2 id="Question2">When does this take place on the Star Wars timeline?</h2>
            <p>The first season takes place five years after Return of the Jedi and 25 years before The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.</p>
        <h2 id="Question3">Is the Mandalorian related to Jango Fett?</h2>
            <p>Not directly. Din Djarin ("The Mandalorian") and Jango Fett were both "foundlings". As in, children who were not born on Mandalore or one of its moons. But were adopted by Mandalorians and raised in a clan. Both are bounty hunters, but Jango Fett died in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, which took place over 30 years before the events in The Mandalorian TV show. At the time of his death, Jango Fett had a clone son (Boba Fett), but it has not been established if he had any other surviving relatives.</p>
        <h2 id="Question4">Why doesn't the Mandalorian keep some sort of land vehicle in his ship since he needs one (sometimes at risk) so often throughout the series?</h2>
            <p>It is plausible he prefers travelling by foot, as seen in many of the episodes. And Later using a speeder and Blurrg as vehicles to cover long distances, but only temporarily. It's likely that he can generally land close to his destination and he will hire a speeder if he needs to go farther.
            <br>
<br>He does gets awarded a Jetpack in the season finale, putting it to great use in both combat and covering distances with ease.</p>
        <h2 id="Question5">Why doesn't anybody seem to know what the child is ? Surely Yoda was well known in the galaxy, and the child does seem to be remarkably like Yoda.</h2>
            <p>The child (Grogu) is not Yoda, but merely another member of the same species. In the original trilogy Yoda is a recluse that only another recluse, and the top brass of the Empire, had heard of. It's not a leap at all to imagine the galaxy at large to have heard only legends or myths and those might differ. Also, while the name of the legendary Jedi Master Yoda may still mean something to people, it's possible his appearance was not widely known.</p>
        <h2 id="Question6">Which characters and/or performers from the original trilogy appear on this show, if any?</h2>
            <p>Luke Skywalker, R2D2, Boba Fett and Bib Fortuna are the most notable original trilogy characters to appear so far.</p>
        <h2 id="Question7">Do you need to watch anything before Mandalorian?</h2>
            <p>It is not necessary to have watched all 11 'Star Wars' films to understand all the details of 'The Mandalorian'. The only important thing you should know is that the series takes place five years after the events of 'Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi', released in theaters in 1983.</p>
        <h2 id="Question8">Will there be a Mandalorian Season 3?</h2>
        <p>he Mandalorian, the show that gave the world Baby Yoda, is returning with all-new chapters and familiar faces! Season 3 of the Emmy-nominated, live-action Star Wars series will be coming back with “the main character that we all have known and loved,” creator Jon Favreau previously shared on Good Morning America.</p>
        <h2 id="Question9">What should I know before watching Mandalorian?</h2>
        <p>There's no need to have watched any of the previous Star Wars films to make sense of The Mandalorian's first season. What you need to know is that the show takes place five years after Star Wars: Episode VI — Return of the Jedi, released back in 1983.</p>
        <h2 id=Question10>What is Baby Yoda's name?</h2>
        <p><strong>Grogu</strong><br>
Baby Yoda's real name is revealed in the new episode of the popular Star Wars series, "The Mandalorian." The viral character known as Baby Yoda now has a real name. In a new episode of the Star Wars Disney+ series, "The Mandalorian", it is revealed that Baby Yoda is actually Grogu.</p>
