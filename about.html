        <p id="info">After the fall of the Galactic Empire, a lone gunfighter makes his way through the outer reaches of the lawless galaxy. “The Mandalorian” is set after the fall of the Empire and before the emergence of the First Order. We follow the travails of a lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy, far from the authority of the New Republic.</p>
        <p>I chose this piece of media because I've always liked the Star Wars franchise since I was little. I couldn't choose a single Star Wars movie because they are all good. But when "The Mandalorian" came out, it was unlike anything I had ever seen. It wasn't a movie, but if you put all of the episodes together, it would seem like a very long movie.</p>
